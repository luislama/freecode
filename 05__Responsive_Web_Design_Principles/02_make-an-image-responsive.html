<!--
Add the style rules to the responsive-img class to make it responsive. It should never be wider than its container (in this case, it's the preview window) and it should keep its original aspect ratio. After you have added your code, resize the preview to see how your images behave.

.responsive-img {
  max-width: 100%;
